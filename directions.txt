The commands immma need to get by in battlesnake:

(inside battlesnake folder)

To add changes to spoder-snek

1) 
$ heroku login
-> email is: cbmathieson@outlook.com
-> password: the usual

2)

$ git add .
$ git commit -m " something here "
$ git push heroku master

3)
-> for debugging
$ heroku logs --tail

---------------------------
run the server:

1) To start the server, 
$ docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 sendwithus/battlesnake-server

2) Go to localhost:3000
   
-> supposed to replace localhost with your inter ip using the value from 'inet' when you prompt
-> $ ifconfig
BUT USE LOCALHOST (only way that seems to work)

3) enter url of your snake:

https://spoder-snek.herokuapp.com
